Part of my daily study of algorithms in Python. Inspired by [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
 
 ## Note
 These codes were created for the purpose of learning only, and not efficiency and consistency. Therefore the code may be buggy. Use at your own risk.
